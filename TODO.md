# TODO

1.  Think about how to pull install version from the repo.
2.  Does it make sense to put all the configuration files under a src folder (or equivalent).
3.  Consider putting all the shared makefile recipes in another repo.
4.  Consider running a mock install before performing the actual install to mitigate silly errors
    that preventing install from completing and leaving a half-installed state.
